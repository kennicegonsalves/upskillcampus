# Blog CMS â€“ Internship Submission Project

A simple Content Management System (CMS) for blog publishing using Java and HTML.

## Features
- Users can write blog posts via HTML form
- Posts are saved via Java File I/O
- Simulates backend storage and frontend content creation
- Basic blog layout and text editor UI
- Mimics HTTP/HTTPS-based serving (conceptual)

## Technologies
- Java (Core)
- HTML5
- File Handling (Java)
- Simulated DB (`blog_data.txt`)

## How it Works
1. Open `editor.html` to simulate blog writing.
2. Run `CMSBlog.java` in terminal.
3. Enter blog title and HTML content.
4. Blog is saved into `blog_data.txt`.
5. `index.html` serves as blog homepage.

## Note
This project simulates CMS functionality for internship evaluation. In a real-world scenario, a servlet backend + database + HTTP server would be used.
